        <h1>Grand Theft Auto VI</h1>

        <p><strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong> is an upcoming action-adventure game in development by Rockstar Games.
            It is due to be
            the eighth main Grand Theft Auto game, following Grand Theft Auto V (2013), and the sixteenth entry overall.
            Set within the fictional open world state of Leonida (based on Florida) and its Miami-inspired Vice City,
            the story is expected to follow criminal duo Lucia and her male partner.</p>
        <p>Following years of speculation and anticipation, Rockstar confirmed in February 2022 that the game was in
            development. That September, footage from unfinished versions was leaked online in what journalists
            described as one of the biggest leaks in the history of the video game industry. The game was formally
            revealed in December 2023 and is scheduled to be released in 2025 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
        </p>

        <h2>Setting and character</h2>
        <p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> is an action-adventure game set in the fictional open world state of
            Leonida—based on
            Florida—which includes Vice City, a fictional version of Miami. Vice City was previously featured
            in Grand Theft Auto (1997) and as the main setting of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002) and Grand Theft
            Auto: Vice City Stories (2006). The game world parodies contemporary American culture, with
            satirical depictions of social media and influencer culture, and references to Internet memes such as the
            Florida Man. The story follows a criminal duo: Lucia, the series' first female protagonist since
            2000, and her male partner; the first trailer depicts Lucia as a prison inmate, and later evading
            custody with her partner.</p>

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>Following Grand Theft Auto V's 2013 release, Rockstar North's then-president Leslie Benzies said the company
            had "some ideas" for the series' next entry. In 2018, The Know reported the game, code-named Project
            Americas, would be set primarily in Vice City and partly in South America with a female protagonist. In
            2020, journalist Jason Schreier reported the game was "early in development" as "a moderately sized release"
            that would expand over time, to avoid its predecessors' developer crunch. In 2021, Tom Henderson claimed
            the game's map could evolve akin to Fortnite Battle Royale. In 2022, Schreier reported the game
            entered development in 2014 and would feature two Bonnie and Clyde-inspired protagonists, including a Latina
            woman, and claimed the developers were cautiously subverting the series' trend of joking about marginalised
            groups.</p>
        <p>The game became highly anticipated in the years before its announcement, and journalists noted
            some fans became frustrated by Rockstar Games's continued silence, particularly after they announced a
            re-release of Grand Theft Auto V in 2020. An individual referencing the game received media
            attention for interrupting several live stage and television shows. On 4 February 2022, Rockstar
            confirmed development was "well underway". In July, Rockstar announced Red Dead Online would not receive
            more major updates as development resources were withdrawn to focus on the upcoming game;[34] industry
            sources stated Rockstar reallocated resources after planned remasters of Grand Theft Auto IV (2008) and Red
            Dead Redemption (2010) were paused due to the backlash received by Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The
            Definitive Edition (2021).</p>
        <p>In November 2023, Rockstar president Sam Houser announced the first trailer would release in early December
            to celebrate the company's 25th anniversary. Within five hours, the announcement on X surpassed two
            previous posts about the game to become the platform's most-liked gaming-related post, later
            surpassed by Rockstar's post announcing the trailer's 5 December release date, with 1.8 million likes in 24
            hours. Other developers imitated the announcement's formatting to promote their trailers. On
            4 December, a low-quality version of the trailer was leaked on X; in response, Rockstar published the
            official version on YouTube, revealing the title, protagonists, setting, and release window of 2025 for the
            PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. No Windows version was announced. The trailer broke
            the record for most first-day views on a non-music YouTube video within 12 hours, with 46 million,
            became the third-most overall within 24 hours with 93 million, and surpassed the lifetime
            viewership of Grand Theft Auto V's 2011 reveal trailer within two days with 101 million. Its featured
            song, Tom Petty's "Love Is a Long Road", saw a near-37,000% increase in Spotify streams, had almost 250,000
            searches on Shazam, and ranked second on the worldwide iTunes chart.</p>

        <h2>Setpember 2022 leak</h2>
        <p>On 18 September 2022, a user known as "teapotuberhacker"[c] published 90 videos to GTAForums showing 50
            minutes of work-in-progress game footage. Schreier confirmed with sources at Rockstar that the footage
            was genuine, and The Guardian reported it was from several stages of development, with some videos
            about a year old. The footage revealed a modern-day Vice City setting, contained animation and gameplay
            tests, level layouts, and character conversations, and depicted player characters Lucia and Jason entering a
            strip club and robbing a diner. The hacker claimed to be behind the Uber security breach from the
            earlier week. They said they downloaded the files directly from Rockstar's internal Slack
            groups, and claimed to possess source code, assets, and internal builds of Grand Theft Auto V and VI,
            which they threatened to publish.</p>
        <p>Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive responded by submitting takedowns of videos showing or
            discussing the leaks hosted on YouTube, and contacted GTAForums and Reddit moderators to remove
            access. The hacker wrote they were "looking to negotiate a deal" with Rockstar or Take-Two.
            Journalists described the event as one of the biggest leaks in video game history; Schreier
            called it "a nightmare for Rockstar Games" which could limit employees' remote work flexibility.
            Jefferies analyst Andrew Uerkwitz called it a "PR disaster" that could potentially delay the game and
            diminish staff morale, but was unlikely to impact reception or sales. The Guardian noted the leaked
            footage was being widely criticised "by ill-informed users" due to its quality, despite not being
            representative of the final product. Some users erroneously claimed graphics and art assets are
            finalised early in game development. In solidarity, several developers shared work-in-progress footage of
            their games and some, including Cliff Bleszinski, Neil Druckmann, Rami Ismail, and Alanah
            Pearce, offered sympathies to Rockstar.</p>
        <p>On 19 September, Rockstar confirmed the leak to be a "network intrusion" and lamented how the game was first
            demonstrated but did not anticipate long-term effects on development. They disabled comments and replies
            on their social media accounts in the days following the leak. Take-Two added that steps had been taken
            "to isolate and contain this incident". Take-Two's share price dropped by more than six per cent in
            pre-market trading that day, but recovered during regular trading hours following their
            statement. Uber acknowledged the potential links to their security breach and noted they were working
            with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Department of Justice. They believed the
            hacker was affiliated with the group Lapsus$, which was thought to have breached companies such as
            Microsoft, Nvidia, and Samsung over the preceding year. Zelnick said no material assets appeared to
            have been taken and the incident caused the companies to become more vigilant with cybersecurity. He
            later reiterated the leak had impacted staff emotionally but business remained unaffected.</p>
        <p>A 17-year-old boy from Oxfordshire—claimed to be "teapotuberhacker"—was arrested by City of London Police on
            22 September as part of an investigation supported by the National Cyber Crime Unit and American federal law
            enforcement. The suspect is a key member of Lapsus$ who was previously arrested under suspicion
            of hacking several other companies. Appearing before the Highbury Corner Youth Court, he pleaded
            guilty to two counts of breach of bail conditions and not guilty to two counts of computer
            misuse. The case was referred to a higher court while the boy was remanded to a youth detention
            centre. In mid-2023, he stood trial at Southwark Crown Court for twelve offences, including six
            counts of computer misuse, three of blackmail, and two of fraud. Prosecutors alleged he threatened
            to release the source code in a message to all Rockstar staff on Slack and had targeted other companies like
            BT Group, Nvidia, Revolut, and Uber. He was deemed unfit to stand trial; instead of assessing
            his guilt, a jury determined he had committed the acts, and he was set to be sentenced by a judge.</p>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rockstar has not confirmed the name of Lucia's partner;[2] the September 2022 leak suggests his name is
                Jason.</li>
            <li>Several sources described Lucia as the series' first female protagonist; Grand Theft Auto
                (1997), the Game Boy Color version of Grand Theft Auto 2 (2000), and Grand Theft Auto Online (2013)
                featured optional female playable characters.</li>
            <li>Based on posting behaviour and IP address data, GTAForums staff believed "teapotuberhacker" was an
                account run collaboratively by two people: "Teapot", the original leaker; and "Lily", who offered to
                sell Grand Theft Auto V's source code in exchange for Ethereum but was not believed to be in possession
                of any hacked materials.</li>
